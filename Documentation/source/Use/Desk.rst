Here you will find how to use the shell.

Login
=====

Once Xila has started (and if the autologin is not enabled), a dialog box asks you to authenticate yourself.
You just have to enter your identifiers created previously.

Desk
====

When you are authenticated the desktop is displayed, you can then observe more area.
A first banner at the top of the screen which allows you to indicate the time, the state of the battery, the connection and the sound, the name of the software which is displayed.
At the bottom of the screen, a second banner contains a button to open the software drawer, and the icons of minimized software.

Drawer
======

To launch the software, all you have to do is access the drawer.
You should see a mosaic of all currently installed software.
