Introduction To Xila
====================

Xila is a lightweight operating system for embedded devices.

Its goal is to offer a simple standardized API.
In this way, that allows the integration of different software in one unique ecosystem.

In addition to that, software written for Xila are easier to port.
Indeed, for any new board / chips, only Xila's Hardware Abstraction Layer (H.A.L.) needs to be changed.
Thus, it's long-term objective is to expand to other platforms like the Teensy, ESP8266, ARM based MCU ...

Then, Xila is highly configurable, which makes it possible thight integration to any embedded application.

Finaly, this project aim is to give the best experience, both to the developer and to the users.
So I strongly encourage you to participate.
You can make your contribution by directly contributing to the project (report bugs, add feature, write documentation ...).
But also by creating third-party software that will give meaning to Xila's existence.
As this project is under an MIT license, your projects will then benefit from a great licence flexibilty.
