Introduction
============

Here you will find how to configure Xila in depth so that it can adapt to all your needs.

For basic configuration, you can also check ççççç.

Firstly, Xila use registries to store its configuration.
These registries have the ``.xrf`` extension and are containted in the ``/Xila/Registry`` folder.
Thanks to JavaScript Object Notation (J.S.O.N.), these registries are quite easy to apprehend.

During startup, Xila checks and loads its various registers.
If a registry is corrupted, it will automatically reset with default values.
If the registry is not corrupted, but the data in the registry is incorrect, you can still delete it.
Xila will regenerate it automatically.

.. warning::

    Be careful with the ``System.xrf`` registry. Because this one cannot be repaired.
    If a corruption occur, it is then necessary to manually replace the latter with a healthy file (can be found in install archive).
