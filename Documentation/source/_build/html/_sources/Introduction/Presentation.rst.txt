Introduction To Xila
====================

Xila is a lightweight operating system for embedded devices (currently only the ESP32 is supported).

Its goal is to offer a simple standardized API (not ABI, due to the fact that MCU requires static compilation).
In this way, that allows the integration of different software in one unique ecosystem.

In addition to that, software written for Xila are easier to port than multiple seperate software.
Indeed, only Xila's Hardware Abstraction Layer (H.A.L.) needs to be rewritten.
Thus, it's long-term objective is to expand to other platforms like the ESP8266, other variation of the ESP32, ARM based MCU ...

Then, Xila is highly configurable, which makes it possible to adapt to a large number of applications.

Finaly, this project being too big to be supported by one person, I strongly encourage you to participate.
You can make your contribution by directly contributing to the project (report bugs, add feature, write documentation ...).
But also by creating third-party software that will give meaning to Xila's existence.
As this project is under an MIT license, your projects will then benefit from a great flexibilty.
