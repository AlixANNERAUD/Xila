Here you will find how registries work.

Indeed, for memory saving purposes, it is possible to use the same registry system as the Xila core for third-party software.
Since Xila's registry are based on the `Arduino JSON <https://arduinojson.org/>`_ library, you can `consult the documentation here <https://arduinojson.org/v6/doc/>`_.
