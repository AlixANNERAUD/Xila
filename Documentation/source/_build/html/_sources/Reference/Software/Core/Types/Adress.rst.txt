Introduction
============

Here you will find a full descrption of the variable Address type.

The variable address type is used by the core to communicate with software asynchronously.
A variable is defined by two attributes: its identifier (encoded on 16 bits) as well as its type (the core returns three types of variable: number (64 bits), string and pointer, however it is possible to use custom types).
This makes it possible in particular to easily return variables from the screen by returning a prefix made up of two characters.

.. warning::
    In order to avoid interfering with the data formatting imposed by the display, please avoid using the values in the identifier: 0x00FF, 0xFF00 and 0xFFFF.
