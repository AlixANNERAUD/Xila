<p>[ronobvious] purchased a Ralink based USB WiFi adapter for use with Aircrack-ng. It worked well so he decided to <a href="http://ronobvious.livejournal.com/296.html">add an external antenna connector</a>. The connector from Linx Technologies that he chose is really what makes this installation clean. It&#8217;s a card-edge design so you just slip it over the end and solder the pin and ground leg. He&#8217;s got a link to <a href="http://www.oberkommando.org/asus_wl-167g/">Tobias Hain&#8217;s similar mod</a> and Tobias has a link to a <a href="http://www.xp11.com/g54/g54.htm">another antenna project</a> as well.</p>

<p>Former HaD&#8217;er [Phillip Torrone] has written an extensive collection of <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/12/open_source_hardware_2009_-_the_def.html">Open Source Hardware</a> projects for <a href="http://www.makezine.com/">Make Magazine</a>. This impressive list covers over 125 projects and kits, broken into 19 categories including <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/12/3d_printing_and_fabrication_open_so.html">3d Printing</a>, <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/12/music_open_source_hardware_2009_-_t.html">Music</a>, <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/12/robotics_open_source_hardware_2009.html">Robotics</a>, and <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/12/wireless_and_gps_and_wireless_open.html">Wireless systems</a>. A number of these projects have been either extensively detailed or mentioned on HaD, so there is bound to be something for everyone here.</p>
<p>[Phillip] is not only detailing these projects for people new to the Open Source Hardware movement, but is also calling for new and unheard of projects to be listed in places like this, as well as central locations such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_hardware">OSH Wikipedia page</a>. We are sure that a number of HaD readers will be answer this challenge.</p>
<p>Thanks again to [Phillip] for sharing this with us.</p>
